# uan-popular-movies-stage-1

Project 1 for the Udacity Android Nanodegree.

Credits can be found below and within the app in the action overflow on the Action Bar.

"Popular Movies Stage 1" needs a valid API key from The Movie Database to run. (https://www.themoviedb.org/)
Please insert the key into the empty double quotation marks ("") line 202 of the file "MovieGridFragment.java" in the app/src/main/java/com.meg_codes.android/ directory.

Let me know here on GitHub if there are any further questions. Thanks!
